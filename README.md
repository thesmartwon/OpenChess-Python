# Open Chess
This is an cross-platform open-source Chess GUI written in python that can be used for playing or analyzing large amounts of chess games.

It is still in its very early stages of development, but the plan is that it would someday be a free alternative to programs like ChessBase.

I want to make Open Chess the perfect companion for lichess.org/chess.com.
Besides various "TODO"s in the code, I am planning on eventually adding:
- 1,000,000 customizations for the board (I believe look and feel of the board is the most important part of a GUI)
- Advantage over time graph
- Endgame explorer (and some theory training)
- Opening explorer (and some theory training)
- Tactics puzzles (lots of mate in...)
- Lesson plans for Beginner/Intermediate/Expert
- Statistics and stat tracking on nearly EVERYTHING. Personal profile page. Lots of graphs.
- A page with descriptions about how stockfish works
- Convienent game library with searching and turning showing board on/off
- Game analysis like lichess, except live
- Play against the machine. Have the machine try out many different decent moves.
- Game commentating (drawing arrows, circles, and squares various for youtube videos/lessons)
- Game annotating (some graphical buttons and icons for game annotators to make and view annotated pgns)

I could elaborate more but I want to program more and talk less 


## Building
Install PyQt5 and run pip-install python.chess on python 3.4. Then run main.py and that's it!
