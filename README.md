# OpenChess
This is an cross-platform open-source Chess GUI written in C++ that can be used for playing or analyzing large amounts of chess games.
It is still in development, but the plan is that it would someday be a free alternative to programs like ChessBase.
GOALS
- Very user-friendly experience but still feature-rich with intuitive places for settings.
