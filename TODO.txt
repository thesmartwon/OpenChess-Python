practical next things to do
- work on action manager doing stuff to the board state
	- add undoing/redoing moves
	- add save dialog





plan for app

X there are are components and chess pieces
X the chess pieces move according to rules
	- need to add promotion piece prompt (hide piece and then create dialog)
X move history in PGN style (needs testing)
	- need to optimize checkmate validation
	- need to make clickable and navigatable. also add variation support
	- need to make "game" class that is actually just collection of a root position and mainline/variation moves
engine support (just text until later)
save and load games in PGN. (only problem will be loading PGN. need to go thru every move and convert to UCI)
	Save as PGN
	- on saving PGN need window to ask for games to select (from game tabs), game info for each game, filepath, whether to save variations
	- on saving those games they open in a new PGN-style window
	Load
	- on loading pgn if format error create prompt showing the problem.
	- on loading pgn open last 5 games as tabs in new PGN-style window
	- window title is pgn name
	- add a PGN stat tab (leave spots for future stats)
	- add PGN game navigator tab
	- add PGN game info editor button
	- eventually .fch and other format support?
opening explorer tab (more like reference tab)
	- name of opening at top
	- replaces movelist tab

stats!!
	- select many games through file prompt or select folder
	- white/black point average per game
	- white/black win %
	- openings played
options menu, with ever-increasing amounts of options (implement while adding)

	- option to download all grandmaster/high level games or select file
	- support other formats of opening table things?
