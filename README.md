# Open Chess
This is an cross-platform open-source Chess GUI written in python that can be used for playing or analyzing large amounts of chess games.

It is still in its very early stages of development, but the plan is that it would someday be a free alternative to programs like ChessBase.

Check the TODO.txt for a list of features I'm planning on adding!

## Building
Install PyQt5 and run pip-install python.chess on python 3.4. Then run main.py and that's it!
